    \section{NestJS}\label{sec:nestjs}

    I couldn't explain it better than the words of the author ``Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building
    efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications.
    It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports
    TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript)
    and combines elements of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming),
    FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).''

    The documentation is found on \href{https://docs.nestjs.com/}{https://docs.nestjs.com/} where you can
    read all about framework components.
    Some components are not up to task and in further sections we will focus on good and bad
    sides of available components and some alternatives.


    \section{Environments}\label{sec:environments}
    Modern apps usually run in multiple environments.
    My recommendation for environments is with code name in parenthesis.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Local development environment (\bi{a})
        \item Local testing environment (\bi{b})
        \item Public development environment (\bi{d})
        \item Public stable development environment (\bi{s})
        \item CI testing environment (\bi{t})
        \item Public quality assurance environment (\bi{q})
        \item Public production environment (\bi{p})
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Local development environment}\label{subsec:local-development-environment}
    Local development environment is pretty obvious as each developer is running the application on development machine.
    Code name to be used for this environment is \bi{a} which as a letter represents first letter in alphabet
    so this environment represents first step in the application development.

    \subsection{Local testing environment}\label{subsec:local-testing-environment}
    Local testing environment (\bi{b}) is where developer runs tests on development machine.
    This environment is necessary to isolate testing of the app completely from local development environment.
    Without this isolation data that has been entered during development could influence test running.
    We usually use same variables as \bi{a} env, but we usually want to change external dependencies
    like database/queues/Kafka/storage so test runs are properly isolated.

    \subsection{Public development environment}\label{subsec:public-development-environment}
    Public development environment is the environment which contains the latest application code.
    It is configured to be automatically built from the \bi{develop} branch.
    This environment is meant to be broken/reset at any time.
    It is also first public environment for use mostly by developers.

    \subsection{Public stable development environment}\label{subsec:public-stable-development-environment}
    Public stable development environment \bi{s} is the environment that is manually updated.
    When team is happy with the state of \bi{d} environment they can promote it to this environment.
    This allows team leads to test the app without interruptions that would come if they used \bi{d} environment.

    \subsection{CI testing environment}\label{subsec:ci-testing-environment}
    CI testing environment is used during the PR verifications in the build pipelines.
    This is necessary for same reasons as local testing environment, just on the public side.

    \subsection{Public quality assurance environment}\label{subsec:public-quality-assurance-environment}
    Public quality assurance environment \bi{q} is environment meant for external evaluation.
    When all issues identified in \bi{s} environment are fixed and team lead is happy with its state,
    this build can be promoted to \bi{q} environment.
    This environment should be same in specs as public production environment, so it can be also used as database
    migration verification or as performance test target.

    \subsection{Public production environment}\label{subsec:public-production-environment}
    Public production environment \bi{p} is environment that is available to the users of the application.
    This makes it last step in build - release cycle.
    As real users are using it this environment should be under constant monitoring.

    \section{Environment zones}\label{sec:environment-zones}
    All of the environments can be grouped in production and non-production zones.
    The app code can then provide developers with:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item More information about errors for example by outputting stack traces, displaying error data,
        and various other info which should be hidden from the real users.
        \item Improve testability by including features to log in as certain type of users, commands that will
        precreate certain data sets, etc\dots
        \item Distinguish between seeding production data and developer data.
    \end{itemize}


    \section{Application Configuration}\label{sec:application-configuration}

    Application configuration in modern development is inescapable.
    NestJS offers a component \bi{ConfigService} which is using \bi{dotenv} package internally.
    What we get is a way to load .env environment file and access the variables defined in environment.

    What we are missing is:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Checking that all required variables are supplied
        \item That variables conform to the expected type (configuration schema)
        \item Ability to use multiple .env files so that you can easily configure local development environment (\bi{a})
        and local testing environment (\bi{b}) for example by having \bi{.env.b} file overriding database name
        from \bi{.env} used by local development environment.
        \item Type safety as we need to use string identifiers when getting the values
    \end{itemize}

    Package \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/convict}{convict} has almost all of the above but has a requirement
    that each setting has default value which will not fail the startup if required variable is not found in
    environment variables.

    \subsection{Zeddy Config}\label{subsec:zeddy-config}
    Zeddy Config is my \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/zeddy-config}{library} heavily inspired by
    \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/convict}{convict} but offers type safety without default values and is
    offering just enough functionality for any app.
    This package also provides variable loading from the \bi{.env} and \bi{.env.env-name} files with the \bi{dotenvize} method.
    With this simple package we cover all missing elements for good config:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Single method load the environment variables into JS variable.
        \item Validation of the configuration schema.
        \item Full type safety as schema type property is transferred to config object properties.
        \item It also has additional method to load multiple .env files (\bi{dotenvize}).
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{minted}{javascript}
import { configz, dotenvize } from "zeddy-config";

dotenvize();

export const config = configz({
  env: {
    description: "Running environment",
    envVar: "NODE_ENV",
    type: "string"
  },
  server: {
    description: "Server info",
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      port: {
        description: "Server port",
        envVar: "SERVER_PORT",
        type: "int",
        validator: (port) => {
          return port === 3000;
        }
      },
      host: {
        description: "Server host",
        envVar: "SERVER_HOST",
        type: "string"
      },
    }
  }
});

// resulting config interface is {env: string; server: {port: number; host: string}}
}
    \end{minted}

    \section{Logging}\label{sec:logging}

    Logging is one of the most basic but very important aspect of application development.
    Logs provide the insight into application processing, helps you reproduce the bugs, and can be used as visible comments.

    Modern logging should be:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Effortless.
        The easier the logs are to write the more developers will use them.
        \item Centrally configured.
        Logging configuration should live in one file, so it is easy to modify and extend.
        \item Optimized for different environments.
        For example on local environments we want logs to be in plain format printed to standard output,
        so developers can read them, but for remote environments logs can be in json format for shipping
        to ELK stack for example.
        \item Adaptable.
        Logger should be easy to adapt to specific services.
        For example integrating with Azure's App Insights.
        \item Versatile.
        It's not rare that logs need to be sent to multiple services.
        Sending logs to ELK stack for long-lasting storage and to Azure AppInsights is common practice.
    \end{itemize}
